# OCP3 - PHP Weblog

This repo contains the source code for my 3rd project at OpenClassrooms.  
No dependencies are allowed, I therefore wrote PHOC - Longinus' **PH**P **O**pen**C**lassrooms framework.
It is a simple annotation-based IoC framework supporting unit tests.
The website is based on it, and uses a standard MVC structure.
It has been tested with Apache2, MySQL5 and PHP5.6 only.
